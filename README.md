# Data_Science_Workflow_with_DeepSeek_and_LangChain
Introduction
Data science workflows require both technical precision and clear communication. Many data science tasks need more than text generationâ€”they require step-by-step problem solving. For example:

##Debugging requires tracing logic, spotting data issues, and interpreting metrics.

##Explaining features means sequencing steps clearly so that non-technical stakeholders understand.

Most language models have trouble with data science reasoning tasks. They often miss statistical concepts or create unreliable solutions. DeepSeek models focus on reasoning and coding, solving analytical problems systematically while producing dependable code for data applications. LangChain connects these models to production workflows, handling prompts, responses, and output parsing.
